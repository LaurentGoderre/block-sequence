# Block Sequence

The data collection stage of the Census and many other surveys ensures that each dwelling in Canada receives a questionnaire. As part of this process, enumerators are sent door to door in some areas to deliver questionnaires that cannot be delivered effectively through other means. The sequencing program is used to develop the most efficient means through which an enumerator can traverse an area.

Sequencing produces two pieces of information as an output. The first is an order that a set of child geographies (blocks) should be traversed to efficiently get through an area. The second is the order that the streets should be navigated.

For more information on what sequencing is trying to achieve, refer to the [documentation](docs/index.md).
